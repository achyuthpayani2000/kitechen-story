    Contact us pages. Everyone has them, needs them, but are you really paying attention to the strategy behind them?

    It’s true isn’t it? One of the most valuable pages on your website is usually an afterthought. It’s one of those
    things that has to be there, but often enough, you throw the necessary information on and leave it at that. What a
    waste!

    The page name itself is a call-to-action; Treat it with some respect.

    Contact us pages are often the go-to for a new visitor on a mission. It’s where they go when they have a question
    and truly want to speak to an individual at your organization.
